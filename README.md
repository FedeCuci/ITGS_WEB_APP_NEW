# ITGS_WEB_APP_NEW

This is the new version of the ISU IT Space after the first one broke down due to a database crash. The work has been moved to this repo
and continued from where it left off.

This is the repo containing all the code used to make the ISU IT Space web app for the ITGS IA project. 

The website is built with Django 2.1 and uses Apache 2, and MySQL. The web app can be visited at http://92.242.62.38/.
